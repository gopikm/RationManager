# RationManager
Client App of Clean-Ration for Ration-Card Holders

Build Insrtuctions:
1. In Android Studio, File->New->Project from version control->Github 
2. Paste the Github link and Import

Possiible Issues:
The server was locally hosted and hence the IP address inside the client is that of the local network, so the network calls won't work unless the IP is updated.
